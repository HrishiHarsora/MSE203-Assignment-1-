Q4) Polymer Dynamics Studyâ€“ Using the provided LAMMPS script, analyze
 the effect of chain length on molecular mobility by addressing the following:
 
 a) Simulate two polymer models under NVT conditions: one with a chain
 length of 10 and another with a chain length of 200, ensuring both
 contain the same total number of atoms. Compute and plot the Mean
 Squared Displacement (MSD) as a function of time for both models.
 
 b) Compare the MSD results for the two models and discuss which
 polymer exhibits faster molecular motion. Explain the underlying
 reasons for the observed differences in mobility
