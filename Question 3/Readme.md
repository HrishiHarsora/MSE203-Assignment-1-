Q3) Molecular Dynamics Study on Nanowire Deformation â€“ Using the
 provided LAMMPS script, analyze the deformation process by addressing the
 following:
 
 a) Generate and analyze the stress-strain curve for the nanowire
 deformation. Identify key deformation mechanisms, including
 necking, dislocation formation, and stacking faults.
 
 b) Provide relevant snapshots of the simulation frames to illustrate the
 deformation process.
