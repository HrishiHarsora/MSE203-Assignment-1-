 Q2) The lammps script is developed for uniaxial tensile testing for a single
 crystal aluminium:
 
 a) Extract the stress (pxx) and strain data from Al_SC_100.def1.txt and
 plot the stress-strain curve for single-crystal aluminum under uniaxial
 tensile loading. Identify key features such as the elastic region, yield
 point, and plastic deformation. Share snapshots of the atomic
 structure at different strain levels to visualize deformation,
 highlighting any signs of yielding or plasticity.
 
 b) Perform uniaxial tensile tests on single-crystal aluminum at three
 different temperatures (300 K, 600 K, and 900 K). Analyze the
 resulting stress-strain curves to determine how temperature influences
 the elastic modulus and yield strength.
